# Verification Protocol

- **Startup:** Always run services in parallel using separate named terminals.
- **Tools:** Use the integrated Browser Tool to verify UI state. Do not rely solely on terminal exit codes.
- **Port mapping:**
  - API: `8001-8099`
  - UI: `3001-3099`
- **Success criteria:** A task is not "Done" until the Agent has:
  1. Started the Rust binary (or dev server).
  2. Verified the UI via the Browser Tool.
  3. Confirmed zero console errors in the browser.

## Current stack (single gateway)

- **Backend:** One terminal — `cargo run -p pagi-gateway` (Orchestrator, Skills, KB APIs on port **8001**).
- **Frontend:** Prefer **Vite** when the gateway is already running: `npm run dev` in `add-ons/pagi-studio-ui/assets/studio-interface` (serves UI on **3001**; React talks to **8001** for API and log stream). The Rust **pagi-studio-ui-server** (also **3001**) opens its own Sled DB and will conflict with the gateway if both use the same `data/` directory; use it only when running without the gateway.
- **Optional:** Third terminal — `cargo run -p pagi-control-panel` (egui control panel; no HTTP port).
- **Verification:** Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3001`, confirm API reachability (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/health`), confirm the Log Terminal at the bottom shows connection to `http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/logs`, and check browser console for zero 404/CORS errors.

## Pre-flight check

Before starting the gateway, run `cargo run -p pagi-gateway -- --verify`. This command:
- Opens all 8 KB Sled trees and closes them (detects file locks).
- Checks if port **8001** is available.
- Exits **0** on success, **non-zero** on failure.

Only proceed with startup if the pre-flight passes.

## Self-correction

- If the browser shows a **white screen** or **"Connection Refused"**, check for `.lock` files in `data/pagi_vault/` and `data/pagi_knowledge/`, delete them if present, and restart the sequence.
- Run `cargo run -p pagi-gateway -- --verify` to confirm locks are cleared.

## Proof of life

- The Agent must describe **one specific UI element** it sees in the browser (e.g. "I see the 'Gateway log stream' header at the bottom" or "I see the chat input placeholder") to prove the page actually rendered.
- Do **not** mark a task "done" until this proof is provided.
